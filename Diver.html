        <h2>Things to keep an eye out for:</h2>
        <h3>
            Never touch an eel! If you see them slowly swim away! Watch out for sharks, stay low to the ground if you see one coming at you. 
                If you lobster hunt make sure you are in the right sesson! Make sure you stay with your dive flag and be causious of others and 
                boats! It is smart to wear gloves because there are many things that are sharp and could hurt you. It is always best to just observe 
                what is happening around you. Do not try and harm the creatures incuding the sea scape. What do I mean by that? 
                I mean the coral and the sand. if you make a lot of sand fly in the air you will not see as many creatures. These animals love their 
                peace and quite.
